### What?

This site is the primary release location for some new documents from the "Facebookleaks" / "Six4ThreeFiles" leak-set.

**If you arrived here from a published article as a reader and just want to read the supporting documents mentioned**, just head to the bottom of this page and click the link.

As more documents are released to the public to support the journalistic work of the publications involved, they may be added either to this site or to the matching [Github repository](https://github.com/BuxtonTheRed/btrmisc).

## Released Documents

Rather than sending document releases only to specific journalists, the decision has been made to provide releases in a more public-and-open manner with an honour-principle agreement on embargo and attribution for publication of any stories which make use of these documents.

If you are a journalist or reporter (including academics, citizen-journalists, bloggers, vloggers/youtubers/podcasters, etc.), you may use the documents provided on this site subject to the *Polite Agreement* below.

(If you are here as a reader *only*, not intending to publish your own reporting, the *Polite Agreement* doesn't apply to you.)

## The Polite Agreement

The documents on this site are offered subject to the following agreement:

1. Each set of documents has:
 - an embargo date
 - a form of required attribution (possibly including hyperlinks)
2. If you wish to publish any story / reporting about something in a document provided on this site, you agree to not publish **your** article/video/etc. prior to the embargo date, and to include the required attribution (including the hyperlinks, if present), given for that set of documents
3. If your story spans different document sets, you agree to abide by the **last** embargo date and to include all of the attributions across each document-set you are drawing from
4. If any other restrictions or requirements are given for a document or set of documents on this site, you also agree to abide by them.

## Your Agreement

I am intending to report on the contents of the offered documents and I accept the Polite Agreement above, or I am Not A Journalist and I am just here to read the documents.
